## Application Features

describe each feature, providing a walkthrough of the logic of the application.
Ensure that the features allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:

- Use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling

My terminal application, labeled Baker3000, is a baking simulation that runs as a machine that ultimately allows the user to bake themselves a tasty lil treat. In order to do this, the simulation includes 6 features (+ the ability to exit the simulation/turn off the machine) that can be accessed from a main interface. I will describe these features in more detail below.

### 1. Main Menu

The first feature of the application is the 'Main Menu'. The main menu is what the user will use to navigate the other features of the machine. After recieving the welcome message, this is where the user lands.
