## Styling

The code for this terminal application has adhered to the conventions outlined in the PEP 8 style guide. PEP 8 was chosen as it promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style.

The PEP 8 style guide can be found [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

## Application Features

describe each feature, providing a walkthrough of the logic of the application.
Ensure that the features allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:

- Use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling

My terminal application, labeled Baker3000, is a baking simulation that runs as a machine that ultimately allows the user to bake themselves a tasty lil treat. In order to do this, the simulation includes 6 features (+ the ability to exit the simulation/turn off the machine) that can be accessed from a main interface. I will describe these features in more detail below.

### 1. Main Interface

Firstly, the main interface is what the user will use to navigate the machine. After recieving the welcome message, this is where the user lands. 

### 2. Bake a Treat

### 3. View Supply Levels

### 4. Refill Ingredients

### 5. Add a Recipe

### 6. Clean Machine

### 7. View Baking Log

### 8. Turn Off
